# TravelExpenseTracker
I design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use travel expense tracking application. For each travel claim (for which expenses are to be reimbursed), the application should record expense items.  An expense item has a date, category (e.g., air fare, ground transport, vehicle rental, fuel, parking, registration, accommodation, meal), textual description, amount spent, and unit of currency (e.g., CAD, USD, EUR, GBP, etc.).  A travel claim has a date range and a textual description (e.g., destination and reason for travel).  Your app supports:   add/edit/delete individual expense items add/edit/delete individual claims email a selected claim and its constituent expense items denote a claim as submitted (no further edits allowed to it) denote a submitted claim as returned (further edits allowed to it) denote a submitted claim as approved (no further edits allowed to it) list all the claims, indicating status (i.e., in progress, submitted, returned, approved), ordered by start date show total currency amounts for a claim when it is listed list the expense items for a claim show total currency amounts for the expenses of a claim A claim may involve expenses of mixed currencies, so the total should indicate the amount of each currency.  The application must be persistent; exiting the app should not lose data.  The application should assist the user in proper and consistent data entry.
